## How to Use This Checklist

Work through each section and record owners, timelines, and blockers. Start with MFA and SSO, then segment access and add continuous monitoring.

### Sections
- Identity & Access (MFA, SSO, conditional access)  
- Device Health (EDR, patching, disk encryption)  
- Network & Apps (micro-segmentation, least privilege)  
- Monitoring (log collection, alerts, response runbooks)  
- Training (phishing drills, incident playbooks)
