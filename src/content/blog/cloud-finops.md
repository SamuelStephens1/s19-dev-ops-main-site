## What is Cloud FinOps?

Cloud FinOps (Financial Operations) is the practice of managing cloud spending through a mix of cultural change, financial accountability, and engineering practices.  
It enables teams to **optimize usage, forecast costs, and create shared responsibility** across engineering, operations, and finance.

## Key Benefits

- **Optimization:** Identify idle resources and right-size workloads.
- **Collaboration:** Finance and engineering align on budgets and priorities.
- **Forecasting:** More accurate cost predictions for future projects.

## Getting Started

1. Centralize cloud billing data.
2. Define accountability for each team’s spend.
3. Automate reporting and alerts for anomalies.
4. Continuously review and improve cost efficiency.

> Cloud FinOps isn’t just about saving money — it’s about **spending wisely to drive business outcomes.**
