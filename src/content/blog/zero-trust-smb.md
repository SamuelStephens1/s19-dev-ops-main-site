## Why Zero Trust Matters for SMBs

Traditionally, companies relied on firewalls and VPNs to keep bad actors out.  
But in today’s world of **remote work, SaaS apps, and mobile devices**, the network perimeter no longer exists.  
That’s where **Zero Trust** comes in.

## Core Principles

- **Verify every access request** — never assume trust based on location.
- **Enforce least privilege** — give users only the access they need.
- **Monitor continuously** — detect unusual activity in real-time.
- **Secure devices and endpoints** — don’t let compromised hardware be a blind spot.

## Practical Steps for SMBs

1. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across all apps.
2. Segment your network and limit lateral movement.
3. Adopt cloud identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Okta).
4. Use endpoint protection and EDR solutions.
5. Train employees to recognize phishing and social engineering.

> Zero Trust isn’t a product — it’s a **mindset and framework** that even small businesses can adopt incrementally for big security gains.
